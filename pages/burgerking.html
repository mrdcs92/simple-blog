    <article>
      <p>
        Burger King’s Impossible Whopper has become a hit for the fast-food
        franchise, but a conspiracy theory that the meatless burger causes men
        to grow breasts has become a growing concern online.
      </p>
      <p>
        Men all over the Internet have sounded the alarm on the plant-based
        Impossible Whopper’s alleged side effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>
          Healthy young man goes to Burger King, gets pumped with a massive
          shot of Impossible Whoppers, doesn't feel good and changes - BREASTS.
          Many such cases!
        </q>
        one Twitter user posted on Wednesday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another person tweeted on Thursday,
        <q>Sure, let's turn our boys into girls fast!!! What a great agenda!</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>
          Social engineering is not enough apparently these days, so let's do
          it with the food that we eat!
        </q>
        another wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>
          There are 1 million nanograms (ng) in one milligram (mg). That means
          an impossible whopper has 18 million times as much estrogen as a
          regular whopper,
        </q>
        wrote James Stangle, a doctor of veterinary medicine in South Dakota.
        <q>
          Just six glasses of soy milk per day has enough estrogen to grow
          boobs on a male.
        </q>
      </p>
      <p>
        Stangle’s number crunching and conclusion, however, may be skewed, the
        Washington Post reported.
      </p>
      <p>
        For one, Tri-State Livestock News is a trade publication for the
        livestock industry and according to its About Us page,
        <q>
          growth and success of Tri-State Livestock News is due to the
          long-term support from the publication’s stockmen and agribusiness
          customer base.
        </q>
      </p>
      <p>
        For obvious reasons, the growth of plant-based companies like Impossible
        Foods and Beyond Meat has become an adversary of sorts to the livestock
        industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, experts have pushed back against the suggestion that
        plant-based foods, often containing soy estrogens, cause men to grow
        breasts or have other negative outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>
          Asians have been eating soy products for millennia and don’t seem to
          be any the worse for it. They have among the longest lifespans and
          best health, at least in classic diets,
        </q>
        said New York University nutrition professor Marion Nestle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>
          There is a special concern about . . . men and boys who eat soy
          products, but again, if you look at populations that eat a lot of soy
          products, there is no evidence of particular problems. No, they don’t
          grow breasts.
        </q>
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more, she said, there’s a ton of research that can make the case
        for both arguments in terms of the health benefits or harms of eating
        soy products.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>
          Whether this is good, bad or indifferent depends entirely on who you
          read and what you read,
        </q>
        she added.
        <q>
          There is an enormous, enormous, enormous amount of literature on soy
          estrogens, and it comes to sort of baffling conclusions. Some studies
          show harm, some studies show benefits. What do you do in a situation
          like that?
        </q>
      </p>
      <p>
        The conclusion?
        <q>
          My take on soy products is that they’re foods like any other, and
          like any other, they should be eaten in moderation,
        </q>
        Nestle said.
        <q>
          Eating it once in a while is unlikely to be harmful. Eating it every
          day and having it as a main source of calories, I don’t know anybody
          who does that.
        </q>
