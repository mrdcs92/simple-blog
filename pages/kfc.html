      <p>
        KFC’s plant-based version of its classic fried chicken sold out
        <q>within hours</q> after being tested at one of its chains in Atlanta,
        Georgia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier this week, it was announced that the fast food restaurant
        planned on testing its Beyond Fried Chicken at a single location in the
        US city from Tuesday.
      </p>
      <p>
        KFC stated that the feedback it received from customers would determine
        whether or not the company decided to roll out the plant-based chicken
        alternative in more locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the launch of the nuggets and boneless wings – made from
        plant-based Beyond Meat – it seems customers are very much in favour of
        the new menu item, as it sold out hours after launching.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>
          All of the Colonel’s @BeyondMeat Kentucky Fried Chicken has Kentucky
          Fried sold out,
        </q>
        the official KFC Twitter account tweeted following the launch.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the New York Times, the plant-based version of KFC’s fried
        chicken sold out in just five hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several KFC customers expressed their excitement over the new menu item
        at the launch in Atlanta.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>
          The lines are out of the door, and the verdict is that the vegan
          fried chicken is worth the hype!
        </q>
        non-profit organisation The Humane League wrote on Instagram.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>
          There was a line out the door when I arrived at 10:20am and by the
          time I got my food just after 11 the line nearly wrapped around the
          building!
        </q>
        Ryan Bulzan, senior field organiser at The Humane League, wrote on
        Instagram.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>
          We got to try both the nuggets and Nashville Hot wings, and I would
          certainly be happy eating either of the two again in the future!
        </q>
      </p>
      <p>
        In June, KFC launch a vegan chicken burger in the UK. The plant-based
        menu item proved so popular that it sold out in just four days.
        According to KFC, sales of the burger were 500 per cent higher than that
        of one of its meat burgers.
