    <article>
      <p>
        In a survey completed over the summer, we asked more than 3,000 Business
        Insider readers about which fast-food chains were best at what. In order
        to include smaller and regional chains, we calculated our rankings by
        measuring the number of respondents who said they had visited a given
        chain in the last six months against the number of respondents who said
        that chain was the best in a given category.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chick-fil-A overwhelmingly won the title of best fried chicken sandwich,
        with the number of people who said it had the best one being 94% of
        those who recently visited the restaurant, which is how we adjusted for
        popularity. Popeyes came in second, with 38% of recent Popeyes visitors
        saying its sandwich was superior.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, our survey was taken in June and July, when most Popeyes
        restaurants still served the old chicken po' boy — and not the fried
        chicken sandwich that launched a thousand tweets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Popeyes, however, easily won in the general fried chicken category, with
        the number of people who said its chicken was best coming in at seven
        percentage points higher than the number of people who had been there
        recently, a 107% ratio of chicken fans to walk-ins. Essentially, more
        people said Popeyes had the best fried chicken than had visited the
        chain in the last six months, which is a massive endorsement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chick-fil-A essentially dominated the chicken sandwich space with no
        close competitors, but Popeyes was in prime position to pounce with by
        far the best chicken in the business, according to readers. Popeyes'
        August entry into the chicken sandwich market was an obvious move, but
        also the smartest one the chain could have made.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the move paid off. Popeyes' chicken sandwich brought the chain
        greater brand awareness, and the hype around the sandwich resulted in an
        overall sales boost of over 10% at Popeyes even after the sandwich had
        sold out for the first time. The sandwich drew new customers to Popeyes
        and invigorated the chain's existing customer base.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Popeyes first released its chicken sandwich to enthusiastic
        customer response, Chick-fil-A ignited a Twitter feud that soon
        encompassed all chicken-sandwich-selling chains, big and small. This
        social media rivalry, however, mirrored a very real business
        consequence: Popeyes' chicken sandwich launch affected other chains' —
        namely, McDonald's — chicken sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the chicken sandwich is finally back at Popeyes restaurants
        across the US, those who didn't get to try it in August are now trying
        it for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the death grip it has had on the chicken sandwich market,
        Chick-fil-A has been able to get away with unapologetically unusual
        business practices such as closing on Sundays. But it's possible that if
        Popeyes' chicken sandwich continues to bring more customers to the
        Louisiana chain, Chick-fil-A might find itself singing a very different
        tune.
